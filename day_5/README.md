Today I blindly experimented with matplotlib and came up with this thing by sending the fed's monthly [vintages billions of real dollars data](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/real-time-data/data-files/ROUTPUT/) through matplotlib's [Andrews Curves method](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.13/visualization.html). This isn't meaningful but it's pretty.
