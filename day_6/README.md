This is a new template for dealing with responsiveness and connection to CSS grid: Instead of re-rendering and removing all SVGs, I'm changing only attributes that need to be changed on resize. This speeds up my program and should make it more scalable long term.

I'm using [homeownership fed data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RSAHORUSQ156S).
